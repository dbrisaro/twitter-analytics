# Twitter Analytics Sample

An example project that shows how to gather and analyze Twitter data with Python, SQLite and Jupyter.

The [`ingress`](https://github.com/dend/twitter-analytics/tree/master/ingress) folder contains the script that aggregates the data, and the [`ipynb`](https://github.com/dend/twitter-analytics/blob/master/Twitter%20Analysis.ipynb) file in the root is used to render and analyze the data stored in a local SQLite database.

If you are curious about how this would look like in a web project, check out the [`flask-app`](https://github.com/dend/twitter-analytics/tree/master/flask-app) folder.
